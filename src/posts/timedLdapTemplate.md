# Understanding React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data without reloading the page.
Key Features
- Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state.
- Declarative: Describe what the UI should look like and React will manage the rendering.
- Virtual DOM: React creates a virtual DOM to optimize rendering by only updating the parts of the UI that have changed.
React is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
